### Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is a technique that is used to allow external devices access to computers services on private networks. Here's a simple guide on how to set it up:

1. **Understand how it works**: You can find numerous resources online to understand how port forwarding works for your specific router model. You can either use google or look for tutorials on YouTube.

2. **Use a VPN**: Some VPNs offer port-forwarding features, allowing you to avoid using your real IP address.

3. **Forward the port**: Forward port 6969 on your router.

4. **Share your IP**: Share your public IP address (or VPN Servers IP) with your friends in the following format: `http://<yourpublicipv4>:6969/`
